### Hey, I'm Jens! ðŸ‘‹

After working professionally with music (playing :saxophone:) for 15 years, combined with web development as a sideline job, I turned the two around. Nowadays I'm working as a frontend developer and combine this with music. 

Built my first website back in â€˜96 and have been constantly evolving ever since. I like solving problems, preferably while listening to jazz, and I always have a smile close at hand.
